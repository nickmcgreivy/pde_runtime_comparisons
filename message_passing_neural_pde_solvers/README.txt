There are two files to run: `burgers_replicate.py` and `wave_equation_dirichlet.py`. These files produce the `.png` and `.eps` files in this directory.

Each of these files uses a finite-volume method with explicit timestepping. For the 1D Burgers' equation and the 1D Wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the finite-volume methods are extremely fast, accurate, and efficient.
